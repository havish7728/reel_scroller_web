## What is this sorcery? 🧙‍♂️✨

This magical Python project lets you scroll Instagram reels on your laptop **just by waving your index finger up or down** in front of your webcam. No more awkwardly stretching your hand to click — just swipe like a wizard!

Oh, and btw, I had some AI help to make this happen. Yes, this project was crafted with the *power of AI* 🤖✨ — because even lazy humans need smart friends.

## Why did I build this? 🤷‍♂️

- Because my lazy fingers demanded it.  
- To finally prove my webcam can do more than just spy on me.  
- To make my cat think I’m some kind of sorcerer.  
- Because who actually likes touching a mouse in 2025?

## How does it work? 🔮

1. Run the Python script.  
2. Show your index finger to your webcam.  
3. Move it UP to scroll reels UP.  
4. Move it DOWN to scroll reels DOWN.  
5. Bask in the glory of your new finger powers.

## Setup & Install 🛠️

Just a few magic potions (aka Python packages):

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
````

Run it with:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Warning! ⚠️

* Does NOT work if you’re a ghost. 👻
* If your finger is shy or camera is low quality, it might not detect you.
* May cause your laptop to think you’re doing Jedi training.
